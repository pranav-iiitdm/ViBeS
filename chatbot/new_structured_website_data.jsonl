{"text": "Title: Exploring periocular biometrics for cattle identification in the visible spectrum\nAbstract: The research focuses on developing a robust and efficient cattle entification system using periocular biometrics, designed for real-world deployment in farms and livestock management. The system aims to provide a tamper-proof alternative to traditional identification methods by leveraging deep learning models for periocular segmentation and feature extraction. It must be capable of handling challenges such as variations in lighting, occlusions, and diverse cattle breeds, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.", "metadata": {"title": "Exploring periocular biometrics for cattle identification in the visible spectrum", "abstract": "The research focuses on developing a robust and efficient cattle entification system using periocular biometrics, designed for real-world deployment in farms and livestock management.

{"text": "Title: Monocular 3D Pedestrian Detection Using Transformers\nAbstract: The goal of 3D pedestrian detection is to accurately determine the position, orientation, and motion of pedestrians in real time, enabling systems to predict their behavior and take proactive measures to prevent accidents. Using the transformers in this task, can improve the pedestrian localization and depth estimation as transformers are capable of capturing the long range dependencies.", "metadata": {"title": "Monocular 3D Pedestrian Detection Using Transformers", "abstract": "The goal of 3D pedestrian detection is to accurately determine the position, orientation, and motion of pedestrians in real time, enabling systems to predict their behavior and take proactive measures to prevent accidents.
